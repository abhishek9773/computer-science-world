## [AI vs Machine learning vs Deep-learning]()
- we are using AI write now pattern requation.
- because we don't know the equation of love and feeling, creativity so it's not a fully AI it is the subpart of AI because we using pattern requation.

### deep learning
- deep lerning is  a machine learning. but little bit different they are inspire by nuriouns.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised  (you have input and output both)
    - Regression (identify -> number)
    - Classification (identify -> categries like yess , or no etc.)
2. Unsupervised ( you have only intput data and find pattern like.)
    - Clustring
    - Dimensnility reduction
    - Anamoly detecton reduction
    - Assosication Rule learning
3. SemiSupervised 
4. Reinforement

### General:-
- Date are 2-type 
    1. Numerical (ex- age, weigth, iq)
    2. Categerical (ex- gender)
